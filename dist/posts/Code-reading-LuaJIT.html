      <h1>Code reading: luajit</h1>
      <p>I have started reading LuaJIT sources. I like the fact that the source code is compact and it is reasonable to print and read a whole file (or read it an iPad with <a href="http://ioctocat.com">iOctocat</a>).</p>
<p>The parts I am reading now are the <a href="https://github.com/SnabbCo/luajit/blob/v2.1/src/jit/p.lua">profiler</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/SnabbCo/luajit/blob/v2.1/src/jit/dump.lua">dumper</a>, and the <a href="https://github.com/SnabbCo/luajit/blob/v2.1/src/lj_asm.c">trace assembler</a>. I have a basic mental model of tracing JITs from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/snabb/comments/1y8b9u/tracebased_justintime_compilation_for_lazy/">Thomas Schilling&#39;s thesis</a>.</p>
<p>I have a few interests here:</p>
<ol>
<li>I would like to have a stronger mental model of the data structures involved. How is the Intermediate Representation stored in memory? Is it ephemeral or persistent? How much cross-referencing information is available between the representations: could you generate an interleaved listing of the IR and the machine code for example? (source too?) I am accustomed to knowing these kind of details from other languages like Forth, Lisp, and Smalltalk, but I haven&#39;t dug down to that level of LuaJIT yet.</li>
<li>Does the assembler really assemble backwards from the last IR instruction? (If so then does each IR instruction assembler emit the machine code backwards too?)</li>
<li>How can I always have a visceral feeling for how my code is executing on the CPU? Currently it takes me quite a bit of manual legwork to analyze program behavior: dump traces to a file, profile to see which traces are relevant, stare at the traces to see which code they are related too, and so on. I would love to have this much more streamlined e.g. for the profiler to automatically show me an interleaved IR/machinecode dump of all traces using &gt;= 5% CPU with annotations on the hotspots. This is the kind of thing that is quite transparent in <code>perf top</code> when programming in C.</li>
<li>I would like to have a better feeling for what makes LuaJIT happy, what makes it sad, and what makes it unpredictable. I want to really see in the generated code what are the consequences of things like unpredictable branches within loops. I am sure that I could adapt my programming style to be better suited to the compiler but this has to be driven by a better understanding of the compiler rather than following &quot;do this, don&#39;t do that&quot; lists of program optimization rules.</li>
</ol>
<p>Generally I am very enthusiastic about LuaJIT. I do see it as a technology in the tradition of Lisp, Forth, and Smalltalk: one that is intellectually rewarding to study and use. I look forward to spending a lot more time with it.</p>
